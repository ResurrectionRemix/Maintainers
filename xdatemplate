[B]If you have a major bug to report that has not been reported already, please take the following steps to report it to us.  It will save you, Team Resurrection Remix and me quite some time.

Download the [URL="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pluscubed.matlog&hl=de"][U]MatLog[/U][/URL] app from the Play Store.
After downloading the MatLog app, go to the app settings, and change the log level to Debug.
Clear all previous logs and take the exact steps to produce the error you are receiving. As soon as you receive the error (probably a force close), go straight into MatLog and stop the log recording.

Save the log, and copy and paste the link into the thread with a brief description of the error.[/CENTER][/B]
